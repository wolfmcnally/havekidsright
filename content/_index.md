# Responsible Natalism: A Manifesto

**Responsible Natalism** affirms that procreation and parenting, when undertaken responsibly, are not only fundamental aspects of human nature but are also of self-evident value that contribute positively to individual lives, families, and humanity as a whole. This stance is rooted in the belief that the decision to bring new life into the world, while natural and intrinsically valuable, is accompanied by substantial responsibilities that must be conscientiously considered.

If you largely agree with the contents of this manifesto, you may consider yourself a **Responsible Natalist**.

1. **Inherent Value of Procreation:** We recognize that responsible procreation is a key component of human fulfillment and societal continuity. It contributes to the richness of human experience and the perpetuation of cultural and familial legacies.

2. **Personal Autonomy and Responsibility:** Upholding the principle of personal choice in reproductive decisions, we advocate for responsible decision-making. Individuals or couples have the right to decide whether to have children, informed by an understanding of the personal and societal risks, responsibilities, and benefits entailed in procreation and parenting.

3. **Environmental and Societal Consideration:** Responsible natalism requires an awareness of the broader impacts of procreation. We believe that it is vital to consider both the kind of world into which we choose to bring children, and the kind of world future generations will inherit.

4. **Focus on Upbringing Quality:** The responsibility of parenthood extends beyond the act of birth or adoption. Parenting includes providing a nurturing, stable, and resourceful environment for children to develop their full potential. Whether parents or not, we recognize our role in creating a quality social environment in which children can grow and thrive. We also recognize that parenting is a serious responsibility that once undertaken may not be abandoned to others: especially not the government.

5. **Two-Parent Homes are a Baseline**: We recognize that lifestyles and family compositions vary, and that there is no one “right” way to form a healthy, nurturing family. Nonetheless, we recognize the evidence that children are more likely to thrive when they have two stable parents, and that mother and father archetypes exist for deep reasons that children need to experience, even if provided by figures in their extended family.

6. **Health and Well-being:** The health and well-being of potential parents and the child are paramount. This encompasses physical, mental, and emotional health, ensuring a conducive environment for raising healthy and well-adjusted individuals.

7. **Ethical and Moral Considerations:** We assert that procreation and adoption, conducted with ethical and moral foresight, are commendable acts. This includes considerations of the child's rights and the potential life they will lead.

8. **No Life is Perfect:** We recognize that there are no perfect parents or perfect societies in which to raise children. We recognize that life itself involves hardships, struggle, and death; but also offers joy, achievement, deep purpose, and transcendence. We affirm life’s challenges as part of its purpose, endeavoring to pass this understanding and our other values on as part of our abiding commitment to ourselves, our children, our families, our societies, and humanity.

## Author's Notes

The manifesto is the personal statement of its author and does not represent the position of any organization, political party, or other established group interest.

To avoid confusion, the author wishes to make his philosophical and political priors clear. So before you write to complain about the treatment or omission of a topic, please read the following:

- **Pro-Human:** The author is "Team Human" and wrote this manifesto,
    - as a counterbalance to extinctionist ideologies like _antinatalism_: the pseudo-philosophy that asserts bringing children into existence is perforce "harm" and therefore that having children is a moral wrong, and
    - to proffer a positive affirmation of the value of human life.
- **Not "Pro-Natalist":** The author does not naively advocate for higher birth rates. The manifesto is about personal responsibility and decision making, while upholding procreation and parenting as positive personal and social values.
- **Pro Two-Parent:** Even single parents who deeply consider the evidence should concede that two-parent families with a mother and father are better in the main.
- **Controversies:** The author is not trying to avoid controversy or please everyone. This is a manifesto upholding the value of personal responsibility, natalism, and parenting.
- **Completeness and Nuance:** This is a short manifesto, not a book.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Th manifesto is about personal responsibility, not abstract social contracts or government entitlements.
- **Environment and Social Justice:** The manifesto is not about "social justice". It also doesn't pander to woke bullshit like "anthropogenic climate crisis", "anti-racism" or "de-colonialism." If you wish to object to their absence in the manifesto the author wishes to be clear: these omissions aren't merely negligent, they're _snubs_.
- **Culture:** The author upholds Western values and is unapologetic about that.
- **Action Steps:** This is left for future writings. If you must have one I'd offer, “Clean your room!”

That said, the author is open to suggestions for improving the manifesto. You may contact the author <a href="mailto:wolf@wolfmcnally.com?subject=Responsible Natalism">here</a>.
