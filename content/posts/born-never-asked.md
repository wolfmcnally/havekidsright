![Born Never Asked](/born-never-asked.webp)

It was a large room full of people, all kinds.<br/>
And they had all arrived at the same building<br/>
at more or less the same time.<br/>
And they were all free.<br/>
And they were all asking themselves the same question:<br/>
<br/>
"What is behind that curtain?"<br/>
<br/>
You were born.<br/>
And so you're free.<br/>
So happy birthday.<br/>
<br/>
â€” Laurie Anderson
