![Born Never Asked](/born-never-asked.webp)

It was a large room full of people, all kinds.<br/>
And they had all arrived at the same building<br/>
at more or less the same time.<br/>
And they were all free.<br/>
And they were all asking themselves the same question:<br/>
<br/>
"What is behind that curtain?"<br/>
<br/>
You were born.<br/>
And so you're free.<br/>
So happy birthday.<br/>
<br/>
— Laurie Anderson

[Listen to the Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0ltGjJ7_U8)

By neither condemning nor condoning the act of coming into existence, Laurie Anderson's "Born Never Asked" occupies a unique space that acknowledges the complexity of life with a sense of equanimity. This acknowledgment that existence simply happens, and that we are here to witness and welcome it, offers a perspective that transcends the polarized views often found in discussions about the ethics of birth and existence.

The mostly instrumental nature of the song, coupled with its pensive mood, serves to underscore the multifaceted experiences of life—its joys and burdens, its certainties and mysteries. Anderson's work invites listeners to reflect on the inherent conditions of existence without imposing a judgmental stance, encouraging a contemplative appreciation for the phenomenon of life itself.

This nuanced approach allows for a deeper engagement with the existential questions that define the human condition, promoting a sense of wonder and acceptance rather than resignation or contention. It's a celebration of the complexity and ambiguity of being, recognizing the beauty in witnessing and participating in the unfolding narrative of existence.
