+++

The manifesto is the personal statement of its author and does not represent the position of any organization, political party, or other established group interest.

To avoid confusion, the author wishes to make his philosophical and political priors clear. So before you write to complain about the treatment or omission of a topic, please read the following:

- **Pro-Human:** The author is "Team Human" and wrote this manifesto,
    - as a counterbalance to extinctionist ideologies like _antinatalism_: the pseudo-philosophy that asserts bringing children into existence is perforce "harm" and therefore that having children is a moral wrong, and
    - to proffer a positive affirmation of the value of human life.
- **Not "Pro-Natalist":** The author does not naively advocate for higher birth rates. The manifesto is about personal responsibility and decision making, while upholding procreation and parenting as positive personal and social values.
- **Pro Two-Parent:** Even single parents who deeply consider the evidence should concede that two-parent families with a mother and father are better in the main.
- **Controversies:** The author is not trying to avoid controversy or please everyone. This is a manifesto upholding the value of personal responsibility, especially when having kids and in parenting.
- **Completeness and Nuance:** This is a short manifesto, not a book.
- **Policy Recommendations:** The manifesto is about personal responsibility, not abstract social contracts or government entitlements.
- **Environment and Social Justice:** The manifesto is not about "social justice". It also doesn't pander to woke bullshit like "anthropogenic climate crisis", "anti-racism" or "de-colonialism." If you wish to object to their absence in the manifesto the author wishes to be clear: these omissions aren't merely negligent, they're _snubs_.
- **Culture:** The author upholds Western values and is unapologetic about that.
- **Action Steps:** This is left for future writings. If you must have one I'd offer, “Clean your room!”
